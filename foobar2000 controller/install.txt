Installation requires both PC and Phone steps.

PC: 
1. Choose either the original method (2a) (files as provided by original dev) or new method (2b) (with updated components + fixes).
2a. Go to 'PC_original_installation_2.0.1' folder and install 'foobar2000 controller [PC-side setup] v2.0.1.exe'. Decompressed files are also provided in case someone wants to manually install them (i.e. copy them into the profile folder).
2b. Go to 'PC_new_installation_2.0.1' and install 'foo_httpcontrol_0_97_29.fb2k-component' into foobar2000. Copy 'foo_httpcontrol_data' subfolder into foobar2000 profile folder (so new template will be added to the default templates folder).
3. Set server as desired.

Android:
1. Install foobar2000 controller PRO_0.9.4.0a.
2. Add server using settings from PC installation step 3.
