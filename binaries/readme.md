These are the required/optional binaries for all my scripts: essentia, exiftool, ffmpeg, ffprobe, fpcalc, ghostscrip, pingo

Choose x86 or x64 file according to your OS architecture.

They should be installed at '[foobar profile]\binaries'. So it looks like '[foobar profile]\binaries\essentia', etc.

You can download every file one by one or using the following link:
